For our project, we've developed a dynamic choropleth map showcasing the median income of each US state from 1984 to 2018. The map utilizes a color gradient, ranging from white to green, to depict income concentration, with white representing lower incomes and green indicating higher incomes. We chose to use the color green because it is the color of cash, which is related to income. Hovering over a state triggers an orange highlight, accompanied by a display of the state's median income. Additionally, users can interact with a slider located at the top right of the screen to adjust the year dynamically, altering the choropleth map's color concentration accordingly.


To aid interpretation, we've included a legend below the map explaining the color scale. This design choice ensures users can easily discern income disparities between states without the need to hover over each individually. While considering alternative visualizations, such as using differently sized circles to represent income levels, we ultimately opted for the choropleth map for its intuitive nature. Locating a state on a map is more instinctive for users compared to identifying circles with state symbols, enhancing overall user experience and comprehension.


Our development processes consisted of coming up with interesting questions and trying to find a dataset that would make the visualization possible. Before working on the website, we first needed to find and clean a dataset we found on median incomes for each state. Afterwards, we had to look for the geojson file of the United States. After cleaning the dataset and making it usable, we started developing the choropleth map. 


For our project, we convened on a Zoom call to brainstorm and sourcing data. Eshaan was in charge of looking for data while Lewis and Steven collaborated on extensive data cleaning tasks. Originally, the data was an excel spreadsheet, so we utilized the pandas library to clean the data by removing filtering columns and format it in a way in which we can convert it into a json file. We had to transpose the data and extrapolate each year to make it into a nested json keyed by year then state. Subsequently, Steven and Lewis tackled the development of the choropleth map, with Steven spearheading the implementation of interactive features. Given Steven's proficiency in JavaScript and frontend development, he assumed a leadership role in coding activities.


As a team, we collectively contributed to the process of website hosting. The bulk of our project's time—approximately 30 hours—was spent working with D3 and coding the website, although cleaning the data itself took hours too. In crafting the project's documentation, Lewis and Eshaan collaborated together while Steven helped with proofreading.
